## Filtered Stream

#### Elevated access
---

+ 25 rules per stream
+ 50 requests per 15 minutes when using the POST /2/t weets/search/stream/rules endpoint to add rules
+ Can only use the core operators when building your rule
+ Can build rules up to 512 characters in length
+ Cannot use the recovery and redundancy features

#### Operator Types
---
+ Standalone
  + can be used alone or together with any other operator
+ Conjunction-required
  + can only be used when at least one standalone operator is included
    + since they are too general and result in high tweet vol.


#### Possibly useful Operator for this project
---
+ :lang
  + Matches Tweets that have been classified by Twitter as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the tweet has been classified). It is important to note that each Tweet is currently only classified as being of one language, so ANDâ€™ing together multiple languages will yield no results.
+ @
  + Matches any Tweet that mentions the given username, if the username is a recognized entity (including the @ character).
Example: (@twitterdev OR @twitterapi) -@twitter
+ context: 
  + NEW Matches Tweets with a specific domain id and/or domain id, enitity id pair where * represents a wildcard. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on Tweet annotations.

+ entity: 
  + NEW Matches Tweets with a specific entity string value. To learn more about this operator, please visit our page on annotations.
